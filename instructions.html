The hundreds board is a great tool for teaching a variety of math concepts.  Every student should have their own number grid.  Remember in terms of differentiation, everybody is not necessarily on the same page.  For example, some students might be working on a number board that goes up to 20 while another could be working on a number grid that goes up to 200.  Number grids are great for teaching a variety of concepts including addition and subtraction strategies, reading number words and ordering numbers.  See the list below for some ideas.
<ul>
<li>Adding +1</li>
<li>Adding +10</li>
<li>Subtracting -1</li>
<li>Subtracting -10</li>
<li>Teaching compensation with +8</li>
<li>Teaching compensation with +9</li>
<li>Use the hundred chart as a number line to do addition and subtraction beyond what your child normally can handle. Take turns making up problems for each other to solve. Develop mental math skills by showing how to add or subtract the tens first</li>
<li>Look for addition and subtraction patterns. 3+7=? Now go to 23+7, 33+7, 63+7. What do you notice? What do 15-6, 25-6, 45-6, etc. have in common? Find patterns.</li>
<li>Count by whatever number you want, but start at an unusual place. Count by 5, starting at 18. Or count by 2, but start with 37. Or for a tougher challenge, practice your mental subtraction skills: count down by the number of your choice.</li>
<li>How many numbers are there from 11 to 25? Are you sure? What does it mean to count from one number to another? When you count, do you include the first number, or the last one, or both, or neither? Talk about inclusive and exclusive counting, and then make up counting puzzles for each other.</li>
<li>Make the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers. On a printed chart, blacken the box for the number 1, which is neither prime nor composite. Circle the next unmarked number (2), and then cross out all of its multiples—that is, count by 2’s and cross out every number you land on, except for 2 itself. Circle the next unmarked number (3), and then cross out all of its multiples. Keep going until every number is either circled (prime) or crossed out (composite).</li>
</ul>
