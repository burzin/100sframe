The hundreds board is a great tool for teaching a variety of math concepts.  Every student should have their own number grid.  Remember in terms of differentiation, everybody is not necessarily on the same page.  For example, some students might be working on a number board that goes up to 20 while another could be working on a number grid that goes up to 200.  Number grids are great for teaching a variety of concepts including addition and subtraction strategies, reading number words and ordering numbers.  See the list below for some ideas.

Subtracting -1
